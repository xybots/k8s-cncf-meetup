Implementing a Kubernetes cluster can be difficult and time-consuming. To reduce the time to deployment, several cloud providers provide fully managed Kubernetes clusters. In this talk, we give an overview of some of the available managed K8s options, deep dive into their feature sets and highlight differences.

At Banzai Cloud, we have direct experience with K8s on six cloud providers as well as with our own Kubernetes distribution. We’d like to focus the conversation on the providers that are most interesting to you, so please vote for the top three out using this poll:

Note: if you use a provider that is not listed here, and are willing to present, we’d be very happy to hear from you!
